# Lottery-Ticket-System
Using Django python library to access our database.
Each table of our database is a pandas dataframe and will be pushed to pickle files.
We will grab the tables from the pickle files and if they are manipulated in any way the dataframe will be manipulated accordingly and pushed back onto the same pickle file.
