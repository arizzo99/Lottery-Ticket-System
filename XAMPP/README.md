XAMPP is a super easy way for us to work on the website and connect it to a database using php and a tad bit of MySQL quieries, I'm learning php as I go but there are tutorials with very helpful functions that serve the purpose of this project perfectly.\
All you need to do is install XAMPP for whatever OS you're using and once installed open it and start the Apache and MySQL servers.\
After this navigate to where you installed XAMPP and navigate to the htdocs folder. \
Once at the htdocs folder you will make a folder for the website named login-register and paste all of the files within this github folder into the folder you just made.\
From here you can run the website locally from going to your browser and entering 'localhost/log-register/name.php' where name.php is the respective page you would like to view.\
To access the tables of our database navigate to 'localhost/phpmyadmin' and from there you should be able to make a database and add tables respectively.\
All of the content within our mySQL databases will be unique however as long as all of our attributes are the same and use the same naming convention we should have no problems.\
I have included a screenshot of the database I made in regards to the users table in this folder please follow it to a tea when creating yours.\
After that please try testing the login/registration system and get somewhat of a grasp on the code. \
I can answer any questions necessary if you just ping me on discord. \
